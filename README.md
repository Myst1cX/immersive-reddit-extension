![icon128](https://github.com/Myst1cX/immersive-reddit-extension/blob/main/logo%2FReaddit.png)

A browser extension with the aim to improve the readability of Reddit pages.
The extension works seamlessly on Microsoft Edge, enhancing the browsing experience by transforming standard URLs
into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates with the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature.

Please note that this extension is being tested and developed solely on the Edge browser. 
Support for other browsers is not coming. 

## Features
#### ALPHA VERSION(v1.0.0)
The extension transforms the standard URL of a Reddit page into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature and opens the page in a new tab.
#### READDIT(v3.00)              
(Description will be added soon)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open Microsoft Edge browser.
3. Go to `edge://extensions`.
4. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch.

## Usage

1. Launch the extension by clicking on its icon in the browser toolbar.
2. Enter the names of subreddits for which you wish to enable the extension. You can add multiple at once by separating each input with a comma. You don't need to put r/ in front of each subreddit.
FOR EXAMPLE: "nosleep","DarkTales","gtripp14" is sufficient. --> the quotation marks are not necessary
3. If you make a typo, you can always edit or delete the subreddit from the list.
4. Head to your chosen subreddit.
NOTE: The extension does not transform subreddits themselves, only their posts. Once you click on a post inside the subreddit, it will automatically open in Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader mode. 
5. Enjoy the improved reading experience :)
