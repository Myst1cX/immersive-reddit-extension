# READDIT - IMMERSIVE READER EXTENSION FOR EDGE

![icon128](https://github.com/Myst1cX/immersive-reddit-extension/blob/main/logo%2FReaddit.png)

A browser extension with the aim to improve the readability of Reddit pages.
The extension works seamlessly on Microsoft Edge, enhancing the browsing experience by transforming standard URLs
into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates with the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature.

Please note that this extension is being tested and developed solely for the Edge browser. 
Support for other browsers is not coming. 

## Features

#### ALPHA VERSION (v1.0.0)
>The extension transforms the standard URL of a Reddit page into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature and opens the page in a new tab. 
#### READDIT (v3.00)              
>The user can choose for which subreddits they wish to enable the extension. Multiple subreddits can be added at once, by separating each input with a comma. As before, the extension transforms the standard URL of a Reddit page into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature. It no longer opens the transformed page in a new tab, but reloads the page instead. The extension only transforms the subreddit's posts once they are clicked, which means that the user can freely browse the subreddit to locate the story they wish to read.
#### READDIT STABLE (v4.00)
THE EXTENSION UI HAS BEEN REVAMPED.

## Usage

>Launch the extension by clicking on its icon in the browser toolbar.                  
>Enter the names of subreddits for which you wish to enable the extension.

>NOTE:                                      
You don't need to put r/ in front of each subreddit.                                   
Spaces between commas are optional.                         
>INPUT EXAMPLE:                                          "nosleep,DarkTales,gtripp14"                                               
>If you make a typo, you can always edit or delete the subreddit from the list.            
>Use the "Search bar" to easily find a certain subreddit inside your added subreddits list.                               
>Click on the "Lightbulb" to toggle between light and dark mode.                       
>Head to your chosen subreddit.               
>NOTE:                                                                                 
The extension does not transform subreddits themselves, only their posts. Once you click on a post inside the subreddit, it will automatically open in Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader mode.           
>Enjoy the improved reading experience :)
