A browser extension with the aim to improve the readability of Reddit pages.
The extension works seamlessly on Microsoft Edge, enhancing the browsing experience by transforming standard URLs
into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates with the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature.

Please note that this extension is being tested and developed solely on the Edge browser. 
Support for other browsers is not coming. 

## Features

The extension transforms the standard URL of a Reddit page into a more readable format using the read:// protocol that integrates the Microsoft Edge's Immersive Reader feature and opens the page in a new tab.
#### BETA VERSION (v2.0.0)              
The extension now automatically copies the transformed URL to your clipboard, before opening the page in a new tab.
(If you don't require this feature, feel free to continue using the ALPHA version)
